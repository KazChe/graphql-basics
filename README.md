## GraphQL Basics 

- Building a out a simple GraphQL application from scratch
- Uses graphql-yoga
- For Subscription `graphql-subscriptions`

#### Build

- `npm i`
- `npm start` - starts up with nodemon
- Go to http://localhost:4000 (GraphQL Playground)
- The code in the root covers basic from-scratch graphql concepts
- Code under graphql-prisma includes integration with Postgres db deployed in Heroku, adds Prisma running as Docker cotainer
and I build Types covered in the from-scratch-code base.
